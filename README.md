// Structure Breakout EA MT4 README

This README file provides an overview of the code developed for the Structure Breakout EA MT4. The code is designed to trade based on the structure breakout strategy, identifying and capturing trend breakouts in the Forex market.

### Input Parameters

The EA has the following input parameters:

- Symbol: Specifies the currency pair to trade (default: EURUSD).
- Timeframe: Specifies the timeframe to use (default: H1).
- RiskPercentage: Specifies the risk percentage per trade (default: 2.0).
- StopLoss: Specifies the stop loss in pips (default: 50).

### Global Variables

The EA uses the following global variables:

- LotSize: Represents the calculated lot size based on the risk percentage and account balance.
- MagicNumber: Represents the unique identifier for the EA's trades.

### Initialization Function

The OnInit() function is called during the EA's initialization process. It calculates the lot size based on the risk percentage and account balance.

### Start Function

The OnStart() function is called when the EA starts trading. It performs the following steps:

1. Checks for market consolidation periods using the IsConsolidationPeriod() function.
2. If a consolidation period is detected, the EA proceeds to detect structure breakouts using the DetectBreakoutLevel() function.
3. Calculates the entry and exit points based on the breakout level and stop loss.
4. Places a buy trade using the OrderSend() function with the calculated parameters.
5. Prints a confirmation message if the trade is executed successfully or an error message if the trade execution fails.

### Custom Functions

The code includes two custom functions:

1. IsConsolidationPeriod(): This function checks for market consolidation periods. It should be implemented with the logic to identify consolidation periods.
2. DetectBreakoutLevel(): This function detects structure breakouts. It should be implemented with the logic to detect structure breakouts.
